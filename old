### What this repository is about?

From the information I have gathered, we can separate machine learning algorithms in 4 parts: 
- Basics Machine Learning Algorithms
- Neural Network
- Reinforcement Learning
- Evolutionary Algorithms

I will learn these concepts in that order, and I will documents the ressources I used down below.

### How did I categorized the information ?

The information is presented in the same way I learn a new concept. First, I usually try to research a topic first to have a good overview on how things fit together, and then I build my own learning path. I get my inspiration from Wikipedia, college curriculum and table of contents in books. Then, I learn the theory about the algorithms, and finally, I code it on Python.

### Why did I choose to code in Python instead of R?

Althought I love R, I find that there are more ressources for machine learning on Python, so I keep R mainly for data visualization and statistical analysis. In my experience, Python offers more package for modelling whereas R offers more package for statistics and plotting.

### Some questions I had when I started learning Machine Learning

##### What is machine learning?

Wikipedia defines machine learning as "the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead". Instead of providing a specific set of instructions like we do in classical programming, we provide data from which our model can learn to predict, classify or cluster information using mathematical concepts and programming tools.

##### What is the difference between data science and machine learning?

Data science as a whole tries to describe the data with statistical analysis, forecast future observations with models, and prescribe a recommendation based on those model, where as machine learning only focuses on creating the model for prediction, classification or clustering. Therefore, we can consider that machine learning is subset of data science, as we can use it to forecast future values.

##### What are the maths required before learning machine learning?

You need to master the fundamentals of linear algebra, calculus and statistics. 

Linear Algebra Checklist: 
1. Vectors and Matrices operations: matrices multiplication, dot product, transpose, identity matrix. Used for data manipulation
2. Eighten values, unit vectors. Used for PCA, SVM, LDA, ...
3. Hyperplanes and distances: Used for K-Means Clustering, SVM, ... 

Calculus Checklist:
1. Integrals: calculate the area under a curve. Used for ROC and AUC
2. Derivatives: calculate the slope of a curve. Used for gradient descent
3. Partial Derivative and Chain Rule. Used for Backpropagation

Statistics Checklist:
1. Probability and distribution
2. Bayes Theorem. Used for naive Bayes classifier
3. Hypothesis testing

##### Do I really need to understand the maths behind the algorithm?

In my opinion, no. You don't need to understand all the mathematical equation behind an algorithms before implemeneting it, but you do have to develop a general intuition on how the algorithm works.
If you can't explain it to a 5 years old, then you are not ready to code it yet!

##### What are the real life applications of machine learning

Real life applications of Machine learning includes:
- Quantitative Finance: forecast future risks, predict macroenconomic trends, predict stock market
- Business Intelligence: report business operation, risk management, supply chain, marketing campain, customer retention, market segmentation
- Computer Vision: extract information from digital images or videos to reproduce human vision
- Natural Language Processing: Speech recognition, voice dictation, sentiment analysis, speech to text, text to speech
- Bioinformatics: predict protein structures
- Sports Analytics
- Spam Detection
- Human Behavior analysis

##### Some definitions

- Inputs/Features vs Outputs/Targets

##### How do Models learn?

[to do]

##### What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning ?

[to do]

##### What are the steps process to produce a model

1. Load the data 
2. Separate into training and testing sets
2. Preprocess the data
3. Create the model Structure
4. Train the model using the training data and crossvalidation
5. Test the model using testing data and some metrics
6. Tuning hyperparameters and model structure with Dropout, regularization and Early Stopping

##### Some Python librairies you should know about

1. Numpy: vectors and matrices manipulation
2. Pandas: data wrangling and data manipulation
3. Matplotlib: data visualization
4. Tensorflow / Keras: machine learning algorithms
5. BeautifulSoup: data scrapping

### Questions that I currently ask myself

- What is the right learning to coding ratio?
- When am I ready to do my own project?
- Should I learn a package first or learn it as I need to?
